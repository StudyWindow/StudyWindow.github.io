Welcome to the StudyWindow! This application is designed to help users monitor their study time and stay motivated. Below you'll find an overview of the features and instructions on how to use the application.


## Features

- **Green Striped Progress Bar**: Displays how much time is left before the page auto-refreshes. This helps ensure that users are always viewing the most up-to-date content.
- **Red Progress Bars**: Show the percentage of time spent studying on a 24-hour scale. This visual representation helps users track their daily study habits and stay focused.
- **Frequent Content Updates**: The page content updates frequently to provide real-time information. Users must keep their internet connection on at all times to ensure they receive the latest updates.

## Motivation

The creation of this application was motivated by the desire to help others stay focused and productive. As I saw others concentrating on their studies, it inspired me to focus on building this tool. I hope it will have the same positive impact on all its users.
